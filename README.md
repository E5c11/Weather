Due to time constraints this is what I was able to produce.

Setup:
Please add 
API_KEY = "{api_key}"
to local.properties to build the app

This app consists of three screens

Home/Weather:
Gets the current weather depending on your location

Map:
Uses the centre of the map location and finds nearby stations and displays the temperature on the map

History:
Displays the current weather from local storage of all previously searched locations, if the information is still relevant

Due to time constraints this is what I was able to produce.

What would I add:
1. tests, I believe tests help us to make sure our work is clean. It also gives you the freedom to change things in your code and know when you have broken something
2. Better error handling, good error handling ensures less app crashes and a great user experience
3. gradle, Gradle is the source of many sleepless nights, so having a clean and well formed gradle makes a devs life easier

What did I focus on:
1. architecture, Having a good architecture ensures a scalable app and a clean codebase. Making sure the whole team can work on areas they did not code
2. dependency injection, Making sure everything is injected allows your to confidently mock for tests, as well as removing boilerplate code and initialisation
3. Seperation of concerns, This is fundemental when keeping a clean codebase. If everything is separated it it easy to maintain a big codebase

What I did not focus on:
1. Design and UI, I am not a designer and suck at it. As long as there are clear cut designs I am able to implement them
